# General Assembly Project 2 - Reciplease
This is an application built using JavaScript and React that allows you to search for your desired food and see how itâ€™s made including details about measurements and ingredients. This project was paired programming for 48 hours. I was responsible for ensuring that the back end was correctly retrieving information from an external API, designing the home page, designing the individual recipe pages and also building the filter functions to choose a recipe.

# Brief
The brief is to build an application that consumes a public API and has several components.

# Installation
* Create app - `npx create-react-app APP_NAME`
* Go into folder created - `CD APP_NAME`
* Clone to GitHub repository - `git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git`
* Install yarn - `yarn`
* Start server - `yarn start`

# Technologies used
React, JavaScript, Axios, SASS, React Router DOM.

# Plan
To start off with this project I began sketch out a wireframe of how we want the application to look, what features are needed and also how the data is structured.

# Walk through

# Code examples
<h3>Consuming public API</h3>
To consume the public API we used an Axios request. This API wasn't the easiest to use, to retrieve the information needed we had to use multiple API's and therefore an Axios request inside of another Axios request.

To filter the data depending on the user's needs I created two drop downs that allows you to filter by cuisine and type of food.

# Bugs
N/A

# Challenges
Working with multiple public API's to retrieve the data needed.

# Wins
Creating an application that help others find recipes they enjoy whilst premoting home cooking. Learning to use react and axios has been very beneficial.
