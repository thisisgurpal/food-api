# Brief
The brief is to build an application that consumes a public API and has several components.

# Installation
* Create app - `npx create-react-app APP_NAME`
* Go into folder created - `CD APP_NAME`
* Clone to GitHub repository - `git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git`
* Install yarn - `yarn`
* Start server - `yarn start`

# Technologies used
React, JavaScript, Axios, SASS, React Router DOM.

# Approach taken
<h3>Planning</h3>
To start off with this project I began sketch out a wireframe of how we want the application to look, what features are needed and also how the data is structured.

<h3>Consuming public API</h3>
To consume the public API we used an Axios request. This API wasn't the easiest to use, to retrieve the information needed we had to use multiple API's and therefore an Axios request inside of another Axios request.

<h3>Styling and Components></h3>
To filter the data depending on the user's needs I created two drop downs that allows you to filter by cuisine and type of food.

For the styling I wanted to create something that you can identify which why I chose to use one colour through out as the theme. The cards of recipes have hand written text which can feel down to earth and like something you would write at home ( and hopefully cook ). One the recipe pages there are desciptions of the recipe, ingredients and also links to the recipe itself.

# Bugs
N/A

# Challenges
Working with multiple public API's to retrieve the data needed.

# Wins
Creating an application that help others find recipes they enjoy whilst premoting home cooking. Learning to use react and axios has been very beneficial.
